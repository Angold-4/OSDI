#### 1. 8-bit times

##### 1) Microcomputer
**With the development of LSI (Large Scale Integration) circuits, chips containing thousands of transistors on a square centimeter of silicon, the age of the microprocessor-based personal computer dawned.**

> **In terms of architecture, personal computers (initially called microcomputers) were not all that different from minicomputers of the PDP-11 class, but in terms of price they certainly were different.** 
<br><br>
> **The minicomputer made it possible for a department in a company or university to have its own computer. The microcomputer made it possible for an individual to have his or her own computer.**

<br>

##### 2) Intel 8080

**There were several families of microcomputers.<br>In April 1974, Intel came out with the 8080, the first general-purpose 8-bit microprocessor**<br>

**Let's see the architecture of Intel 8080. We can see that its design concept is very close to Nowadays Intel's architecture:<br>

##### 3) CP/M

**CP/M originally standing for Control Program/Monitor and later Control Program for Microcomputers, is a mass-market operating system created in 1974 for Intel 8080/85-based microcomputers by Gary Kildall of Digital Research, Inc. Initially confined to single-tasking on 8-bit processors and no more than 64 kilobytes of memory.**<br>

**Many application programs were written to run on CP/M, and it dominated the personal computing world for about 5 years.**<br>

> **A minimal 8-bit CP/M system would contain the following components:<br>**
* A computer terminal using the ASCII character set<br>
* An Intel 8080 (and later the 8085) or Zilog Z80 microprocessor<br>
* At least 16 kilobytes of RAM, beginning at address 0<br>
* A means to bootstrap the first sector of the diskette<br>
* At least one floppy disk drive<br>

**However, because of a missed opportunity in the conversion to a 16-bit CPU, it lost miserably to Microsoft's MS-DOS in the 16-bit PC market centered on IBM PC/AT and IBM PC compatible machines, and thus disappeared from the market. Although CP/M introduced the "CP/M 86" designed for Intel 8086 and the "CP/M 68k" designed for Motorola 68000, there are almost no users.**
