### OS Usage
* **<u>Hardware Abstraction</u>**<br>**Turns hardware into something that application can use**
* **<u>Resource Management</u>**<br>**Because of the limited resources that are present in the computer**

#### 1. Hardware Abstraction -- On User's perspective
**Let's see a simple program:**
```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    char str[] = "Hello World";
    printf("%s", str);
}
```
**How is the String displayed on the screen?**<br>
**In normal computers, it would be like this:**<br>
1. **The String is stored in main memory(RAM).**
2. **The CPU will read this strings byte-by-byte, and stored this strings into video buffer. With the X-Y coordinates, color, depth, etc.**
3. **The Graphics Card then will read these messages in the video buffer and then display it to the monitor.**

**Also these are very brief procedure. It seems like very complex.**<br>
**But with the OS: in a User's perspective especially a programmer. It will be simplyfied:**<br>
* **<u>Device Changeable</u>**<br>**Without the OS, if the Monitor or the CPU changes to another model of device. the program seems Unrunable.**
* **<u>Easy to program apps</u>**<br>**From the programmer's perspective, all these hardware details are abstracted out, which makes writing program easily**
* **<u>Reusable Functionality</u>**<br>**The OS interfaces are consistent. The App does not change when the underlying hardware changes**
<br>

#### 2. Resource Manager -- On Computer's perspective
**For a Computer, the resources of its Hardware are restricted.<br>But as a User, we need computer to do many jobs concurrently**<br>
**Looks very contradictory. Generally, there are two ways to deal with it:<br>**
* **<u>For devices like CPU:</u>**<br>**Multiprocesses time Sharing**
* **<u>For devices like Memory:</u>**<br>**Sharing memory but isolate**
