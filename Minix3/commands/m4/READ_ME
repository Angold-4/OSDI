Dedication:

This posting is a dedication to an old 750 that started out running 4.1BSD
and had 1.5 meg, 1 dz11, and 2 Rk07 drives.  It was named yetti [sic] by
accident, and was managed by the author until its retirement two years
ago. [the name yetti now identifies a different machine]

If you have any important fixes and/or speed improvements, I am much
interested. I am also interested in hearing about any unique applica-
tions of M4. I am NOT interested in gratuitous hacks or "neat"
kitchen-sink features.

Testing: 

This directory contains a test file called test.m4.  To use it, type

	m4 <Test.m4 >out

The output file, out, should be identical to M4.out
