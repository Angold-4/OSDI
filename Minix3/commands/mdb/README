README for mdb version 2.6.0

Sept 9/96

Please note the following: 

1) Has been tested with Minix 1.7.4 (32-bit version).
   A previous version was tested with Minix 1.7.x (16 bit version).
   Some optional parts of mdb have not been extensively tested. 
   This is especially true on the code to trace system calls.
   See options in Makefile.

2) I know that the commands are somewhat cryptic; thus  
   there are currently two types of 'help' for mdb
   a) the "?" gives a help page. 
   b) typing "command ?" will give help on a specific command. 

3) The sample comand file and log output. 
   To test this, type something like the following 
   "mdb -llog.new /usr/bin/sleep @sample"
   The output "log.new' should be similar to the distributed "log" file;
   but not necessarily exactly the same.

4) Man pages need some more work.

5) See top part of mdb.c for version history.
