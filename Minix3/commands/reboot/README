This a new implementation of a shutdown procedure. It allows 
the system to go down graciously with informing the
users. This package contains 3 programs:

- halt = Immediately stop the system, no info to users
- shutdown = Inform users, close down the system properly
- wall = Vincent Archer's implementation of wall (Write all)

Installing

Shutdown and halt use a new systemcall, which I've added to
MM. Therefor there are several diff's which should be applied:

callnr.hd - New callnr for reboot(2)
	   Diff against /usr/include/minix/callnr.h.
	   Those of you using a symlink package should
	   change the number and mm/table.c into a free
	   number. I used 54, LSTAT.
param.hd - Defines reboot_flag as a part of the messages
proto.hd - Add's prototype for do_reboot()
table.cd - Interpretation of the systemcall to MM
mm.cd -	   I have added the do_reboot code to mm/getset.c but
	   I couldn't find a getset.c to create a useable diff :-(
	   So you can add where you want it. It is pure code, no diff.

Now edit log.c and search for ``host''. Change this into your
systemname or make it empty.

Shutdown and halt log their actions in /usr/adm/log, edit the
makefile and undefine -DLOG if you don't want this (this at the end of
the makefile). You can change SHUT_LOG in shutdown.c and log.c if you
want it in another file.

Then type a `make'. This will take a minute or so (13 sec. with bcc :-).
Remember to build a new image and update the ps_database.

Type `make install' to place the program's where I've got them.
Use them, try them and let me now if you've got problems running
something.

I have tested to sources both on 16-bits and 32-bits MINIX. I have compiled
it with gcc, bcc and ACK, so that shouldn't really give a problem. Maybe
the standard MINIX-make chokes on the makefile, atleast mine did.

NOTE:
	Make install does not place the man-pages somewhere. You should
	do this yourself.
