/* banner - print a banner		Author: Brian Wallis */

/*****************************************************************
 *
 * SYSVbanner.c
 *
 * This is a PD version of the SYS V banner program (at least I think
 * it is compatible to SYS V) which I wrote to use with the clock
 * program written by:
 **     DCF, Inc.
 **     14623 North 49th Place
 **     Scottsdale, AZ 85254
 * and published in the net comp.sources.misc newsgroup in early July
 * since the BSD banner program works quite differently.
 *
 * There is no copyright or responsibility accepted for the use
 * of this software.
