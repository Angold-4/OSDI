httpd0995 --- A www server for Minix 2 and Minix 3 
written by Michael Temari <Michael@TemWare.Com> release 0.995 2006-05-14

Httpd is a World Wide Web (WWW) server.  I wrote it from scratch so
the setup and configuration will not be like other web servers though
hopefully by reading this document there will be no problems in getting
my web server up and running on your Minix system.

Earlier versions of this web server were in use for many years on 
minix1.hampshire.edu and minix1.bio.umass.edu.

Installation: unpack the tarball in /usr/local/src or another directory 
of your choice:

  zcat < httpd0995.taz | tar xvfp -

An httpd0995 directory will be created and files will be unpacked
there.  The README file explains compilation, installation,
configuration, and use. Please also read the SECURITY file if you plan
to make your system accessible over the net.   

Changes for release 0.995:

- a redirect capability has been added.  If redirect is defined in the 
configuration file then all request url's will be redirected to that 
host with the original request. For instance, if in the configuration 
file of minix1.hampshire.edu this line appears:
   redirect http://minix1.woodhull.com/
a request of http://minix1.hampshire.edu/some/page will return a 301 error 
which is a redirect permanent to: http://minix.woodhull.com/some/page

- several documentation files and man pages have been updated.

Changes for release 0.994:

- calling CGI programs has been made more secure.

Changes for release 0.993: 

- a new method of authorizing proxy.  You will no longer need the Proxy
entry in Auth and can remove the http://* entry in vpath.  The old way
allowed for having different authorizations depending on what URLs were
asked for via proxy, i.e., you could allow proxy access only to
http:://www.hampshire.edu/. Now it is just a simple authorization for
allowing proxy or not.  

- avoids using a Minix 2.0.3 library call that was not present in Minix
2.0.2, and thus can be compiled with either of the two most recent
Minix releases.  

- a -v option has been added to display the current version then exit.

- man pages added, other documentation updated.

Changes for release 0.99: You can set a default in the httpd.mtype
file.  A mime type with no extensions on a line will be the default.
Previously recompilation was needed to change the default mime type.
