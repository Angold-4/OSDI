A small AWK clone for the 16-bit Minix

	We have written this program for the Minix 1.2 to fit into 64K+64K
memory.  When compiling this program, you need the Peter S. Housel's 
Floating Math Package with corrected the atan() function.  Original atan()
function has incorrect argument sequence.

	This program supports Japanese Shift-JIS KANJI code and passes
all the test program of the "AWK programming language" written by original
AWK authors except some programs relied upon the way of regular expression 
evaluation.
