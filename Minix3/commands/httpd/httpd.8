.SH SYNOPSIS
.B httpd

.br

.br 
.B dir2html
.RB [directory] 
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B httpd
is a World Wide Web (WWW) server written by Michael Temari.  It was
written from scratch so the setup and configuration will not be like
other web servers.
.P
.B in.httpd 
is linked to 
.B httpd.
This alternate name is used to indicate the program is a server that is
started by
.B tcpd,  
a program which listens for incoming TCP connections on the passed
port (defined in 
.BI /etc/services ).  
When a connection comes in 
.B tcpd
forks and starts the given daemon program, after possibly checking for access
restrictions and logging the connection.  Therefore to start 
.B httpd
you use:
.br
.B  "tcpd http /usr/local/bin/in.httpd &"
.br
or
.br
.B "daemonize tcpd http /usr/local/bin/in.httpd"
.P
.B (daemonize 
is a shell function defined in 
.BI/usr/etc/rc 
in Minix 2.0.3 and later releases which starts programs as daemons).
.P
.B dir2html
is an accessory program that produces a directory listing formatted as 
web page for the current directory or for a directory specified as an 
argument. It is called by
.B httpd
when a web client references a directory that includes no index.html
file (or whatever alternative to index.html that may be defined in 
/etc/httpd.conf). Since it writes to standard output it may also be called 
as a standalone program.
.P
Options for 
.B httpd
are:
.SH OPTIONS
.TP

.SH NOTES
Running a server exposed to the Internet is risky to the host system and 
to the local network. Consult with the owner of your net before you go 
public. Read the 
.B SECURITY
document in the source directory.
.SH BUGS
None are known, but there are surely some unknown ones. Be careful!
