MINIX needs one primary partition of $TOTALMB MB for a full install,

If there is no free space on your disk then you have to choose an option:
   (1) Delete one or more partitions
   (2) Allocate an existing partition to MINIX 3
   (3) Exit setup and shrink a partition using a different OS

To make this partition you will be put in the editor \"part\".  Follow the
advice under the '!' key to make a new partition of type MINIX.  Do not
touch an existing partition unless you know precisely what you are doing!
Please note the name of the partition (e.g. c0d0p1, c0d1p3, c1d1p0) you
make.  (See the devices section in usage(8) on MINIX device names.)
