		    ASH GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

  1. You may copy and distribute ash code or code derived from it in
source or object form, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately
publish on each copy a valid copyright notice "Copyright 1989 by Kenneth
Almquist." (or with whatever year is appropriate); keep intact the
notices on all files that refer to this License Agreement and to the
absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the ash program
a copy of this License Agreement along with the program.

  2. You may not copy, sublicense, distribute or transfer ash except as
expressly provided under this License Agreement.  Any attempt otherwise
to copy, sublicense, distribute or transfer ash is void and your rights
to use ash under this License agreement shall be automatically terminated.
However, parties who have received computer software programs from you
with this License Agreement will not have their licenses terminated so
long as such parties remain in full compliance.


			   NO WARRANTY

  Because ash is licensed free of charge, I provide absolutely no
warranty, to the extent permitted by applicable state law.  Except
when otherwise stated in writing, Kenneth Almquist and/or other
parties provide ash "as is" without warranty of any kind, either
expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied
warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose.
The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the program is
with you.  Should the ash program prove defective, you assume the cost
of all necessary servicing, repair or correction.

 In no event unless required by applicable law will Kenneth Almquist
and/or any other party who may modify and redistribute ash as permitted
above, be liable to you for damages, including any lost profits, lost
monies, or other special, incidental or consequential damages arising
out of the use or inability to use (including but not limited to loss
of data or data being rendered inaccurate or losses sustained by third
parties or a failure of the program to operate with programs provided
by other parties) the program, even if you have been advised of the
possibility of such damages, or for any claim by any other party.
