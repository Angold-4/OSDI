ftp101 --- An FTP client program  for Minix 2.0 
written by Michael Temari <Michael@TemWare.Com> release 1.01a 2006-06-07

FTP is the File Transfer Protocol client that allows you to connect to
a remote FTP server. 

This version should work equally well with Minix 2 and Minix 3.

Release 1.01a 2006-06-07: minor documentation edits
Release 1.01  2005-02-07: minor bug fix 
Release 1.00  2003-12-14: added "ver" command to display current version 
                          and an ftp(1) man page.

Installation: unpack the tarball, it will create an ftp101 directory. Although
this is a replacement for the ftp client provided in the Minix 2.0.0 and later
distributions, it is suggested you unpack and compile in the /usr/local/src
directory.

zcat < ftp101.tar.Z | tar xvfp -

Invoking make -n will show you what the Makefile will do.

make (or make ftp) compiles a new ftp binary, leaving it in the source
directory.

make install compiles the binary and installs it in /usr/bin.

make installman installs the man page in /usr/local/man/man1. The
directory must exist. 

Note: there is a bug in the version of the ftp client distributed with
Minix 2.0.2 and 2.0.3 that causes a \r (0xd) character to be appended
to file names in the destination directory when files are downloaded in
binary mode using the mget command. The bug was corrected in a release 
prior to 1.00.
