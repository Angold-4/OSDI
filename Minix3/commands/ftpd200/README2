README2: additional notes on compiling and installing ftpd.

Note that the Makefile install options will replace files in /usr/bin
and /usr/man that were installed with the Minix distribution.  If you
are not sure you want to do this you can either rename the original
in.ftpd binary, the anonftp.* scripts, and the ftpd.8 man page to
prevent them from being replaced, or you can edit the Makefile to
change the directory values:
  BINDIR= /usr/local/bin
  MANDIR= /usr/local/man/man8
ASW's practice is to rename binaries with a suffix that indicates the
original distribution from which they were obtained, i.e., in.ftpd.203
for the version distributed with Minix 2.0.3, or with a date code or a
version number.

If you are sure you want to replace the original ftpd provided with your
distribution you  may want to copy the contents of the unpacked tarball
to the main directory tree, in this case /usr/src/commands/ftpd, so that
a new version will be compiled if you do a general recompilation of all 
commands using "make all" or "make compile" in /usr/src. ASW's practice
is generally to make a directory in /usr/local/src for new versions of
major programs. 
Also note that if you create a new man page where one did not exist
previously you will need to run makewhatis to rebuild the whatis
database, i.e.:
  makewhatis /usr/man
or
  makewhatis /usr/local/man

Important: the scripts for setting up and maintaining an anonymous ftp
installation haven't been checked for a long time, I would appreciate 
comments.
