ftpd200 --- FTP server program for Minix 2.0

Ftpd is the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server.  

Important: Release 2.00 incorporates an improved mechanism to restrict
execution of commands on the server.  This is done through use of a
shell script, ftpdsh.  Any earlier ftpd version in use on a system
accessible from the Internet should be upgraded at least to version 1.01,
version 2.00 is preferable.

Installation: unpack the tarball in /usr/local/src or another directory 
of your choice:
zcat < ftpd200.tar.Z | tar xvfp -

The ftpd200 directory will be created.  Read the Makefile to see how
the program is compiled and installed:

make (or make ftpd) -- compiles the binary
make install        -- installs /usr/bin/in.ftpd, and ftpdsh. Also installs 
                       setup.anonftp script.  
make installman     -- installs new ftpd.8 man page in /usr/local/man/man8

The shell script setup.anonftp sets up and verifies configuration for
anonymous ftp.  If you provide anonymous ftp you are letting anyone in
the whole wide world execute a program on your computer.  You want to
make sure it's set up correctly so outsiders can't mess with things
they shouldn't.  

This file is included as README in the source directory.  For more
notes on compiling and installing, also please see the file README2.
