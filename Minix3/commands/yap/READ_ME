This directory contains the sources of YAP, Yet Another Pager.
It can do most of the things more(1) can, and much much more.

Yap has been tested on the following systems:

- DEC PDP 11/44 running V7
- DEC PDP 11/60 running V7
- DEC VAX 11/750 running 4.1BSD
- IBM PC/XT running PC/IX
- NCR Minitower running a System V
- Several 68k systems
- SUN-3 and SUN-4

On other systems, you might have some problems getting yap to run, but then
again, you might not. You can always ask me for help, and maybe even get it.
If you make any changes, please
 - tell me about them
 - mark them clearly, preferably through conditional compilation.

What you need to run yap:

- you need termlib/termcap.
  It probably is'nt too hard to adapt yap to terminfo.
  It might even work unchanged, but I don't know about that. We don't have
  terminfo or the system V curses.
  If you adapt yap to terminfo, I would sure like to get the changes you made,
  so please send them to me (email address at the bottom of this note);
- you also need regex(III) (Either Berkeley style or USG will do).
  If you do not have it, you should define NOREGEX, which gives you
  simpleminded searches without meta-characters.

How to install yap:

- edit Makefile (easy)
- edit in_all.h (easy)
- type "make install"
