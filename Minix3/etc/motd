To install the X Window System, run 'packman' with the install CD still
in the drive.  To start X Windows after you have installed it, login as
root and type: 'xdm'. For more information about configuring X Windows,
see www.minix3.org.

If you do not have sufficient memory to run X, standard MINIX 3 supports
multiple virtual terminals. Just use ALT+F1, F2, F3 and F4 to navigate
among them.
