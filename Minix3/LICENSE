Aggregated Software

In addition to MINIX 3 itself, the distribution CD-ROM and this Website
contain additional software that is not part of MINIX 3 and is not
covered by this license. The licensing conditions for this additional
software are stated in the various packages. In particular, some of the
additional software falls under the GPL, and you must take care to
observe the conditions of the GPL with respect to this software. As
clearly stated in Article 2 of the GPL, when GPL and nonGPL software are
distributed together on the same medium, this aggregation does not cause
the license of either part to apply to the other part.
