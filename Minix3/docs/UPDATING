	You need flex in your $PATH, which has become part of the base
	system. This needs bigger binaries.
	If you don't have flex yet, you can compile it first by doing:
	# cp /usr/src/etc/binary_sizes* /etc
	# binsizes big
	# cd /usr/src/commands/flex-2.5.4 
	# sh build
20061222:
	Install binaries in the right order because the new readdir
	implementation and the new mount program are incompatible
	with older kernels and the new kernels require the new mount.
	# cd /usr/src
	# make includes
	# make libraries
	# make cmds
	# make depend
	# cd /usr/src/tools
	# make hdboot
	# make install
	# cd ..
	# make install
	Installing fails for boot. Reboot the system
	# reboot -x 'unset image; boot'
	Now install everything
	# cd /usr/src
	# make install
20061222:
	The archictecture-dependent/-independent split needs ARCH=<arch>
	in /etc/make.conf, included by some Makefiles and sourced by
	some shell scripts. To install it, type 'make install' in
	src/etc, or simply copy the file over.

	drivers.conf has been updated to include an ACL for mfs. it has
	to be installed before rebooting after an update of the mount command.
20070212 (r2751):
	mkfs needs more memory to make an image; chmem it or do
	# touch mkfs.c ; make /usr/bin/mkfs
	in /usr/src/commands/simple.
20091006 (r5422):
	OSS requires an improved make to be compiled; run "make install"
	in /usr/src/commands/make before running "make world".
