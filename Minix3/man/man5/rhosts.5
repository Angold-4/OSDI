.TH RHOSTS 5
.SH NAME
rhosts, hosts.equiv \- trusted remote users or hosts
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI ~ user /.rhosts
.br
.B /etc/hosts.equiv
.SH DESCRIPTION
The per user
.B .rhosts
and the per system
.B hosts.equiv
files can be used to allow users to use
.B rlogin
or
.B rsh
without a password.  The remote login services first check the system wide
.B /etc/hosts.equiv
file and then the
.BI ~ user /.rhosts
of the intended user.  Both files contain lines of one of two forms:
.PP
.RS
.I host
.br
.I host ruser
.RE
.PP
The first form tells that any user from
.I host
is allowed to login to this system under the same name.  The second form
allows
.I ruser
from
.I host
to login.
.PP
Under MINIX 3
.I host
may be a pattern using
.B "*"
as a wildcard.  One can use this, carefully one may hope, to allow an
entire domain to log in.
.I Host
may also be an IP address, or a network specification in CIDR form, e.g.
172.16.102.64/27.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR rlogin (1),
.BR rsh (1).
.SH NOTES
MINIX 3 has no restrictions on becoming super-user remotely.  Other systems
usually require one to log in as a user and then use
.BR su
to become root.
.PP
You must use fully qualified hostnames, it is not possible to
omit the domain part.
