.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.ft B
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/dir.h>
.SH DESCRIPTION
The directories of the V1 and V2 file systems are arrays of the
following structure defined in <sys/dir.h>:
.PP
.nf
.ta +5n +15n +15n
struct direct {
	ino_t	d_ino;	/* I-node number */
	char	d_name[14];	/* Name of up to 14 characters */
};
.fi
.DT
.PP
The
.B d_ino
field is the inode number of the file named by
.BR d_name .
.B D_ino
is zero if the directory slot isn't allocated.  This number is the same as
.B st_ino
returned by
.BR stat (2)
unless the entry is mounted on.
.B D_name
is the name of up to 14 characters, null-terminated only if less then 14
in length.  Any character other than null or '\fB/\fP' is allowed.
.PP
See
.BR directory (3)
for a portable way to access directories, MINIX 3 is probably the last system
with these old V7 format directories.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR directory (3).
