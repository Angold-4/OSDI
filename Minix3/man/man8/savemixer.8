.SH NAME
savemixer - Open Sound System program for saving and restoring mixer settings.

.SH SYNOPSIS
savemixer [-LVv] [-f <fname>]

.SH DESCRIPTION
The savemixer program saves mixer settings. It can also load saved mixer
settings back into the mixer.

Running this program without any parameters will save the current mixer
settings into /etc/oss/mixer.save or $OSSLIBDIR/etc/mixer.save file.
OSSLIBDIR is decided by reading /etc/oss.conf, and defaults to /usr/lib/oss.

.SH AUTOMATIC SAVE
By default the soundoff command will automatically run savemixer to save
the active mixer settings. See the manual page for soundoff(1) if you
like to turn this feature off.

.SH OPTIONS
-f<fname>	Use <fname> as setting file.
-L 		Loads saved mixer and device map information from mixer.save.
-V 		Version information.
-v 		Verbose output.
