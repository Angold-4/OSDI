.TH REBOOT 8
.SH NAME
reboot \- reboot the system immediately
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBreboot\fP [\fB\-f\fP]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Reboot
can be used to reboot the system after installing a new kernel.  It does
not inform the users, but does log it's actions in
.B /usr/adm/wtmp
and
.BR /usr/adm/log .
The system is then rebooted with the
.BR reboot (2)
systemcall.
.PP
If the
.B \-f
flag is not given then all processes are sent terminate
signals to give them a chance to die peacefully before the
.B reboot()
call.
.PP
If the wtmp file exists,
.B reboot
logs itself as if it were a shutdown.  This is done to prevent
.BR last (1)
from talking about system-crashes.
.B Reboot
is registered as is in the log file.
.PP
.B Reboot
can only be executed by the super-user.  Any other caller will be
refused, either by
.BR reboot (8)
or by
.BR reboot (2).
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR reboot (2),
.BR shutdown (8),
.BR halt(8),
.BR boot (8).
.SH BUGS
The error message's given by
.B reboot
are not always useful.  There are several routines that can fail, but which
are not fatal for the program.
