.SH NAME
ossinfo - Open Sound System legacy device management utility.

.SH DESCRIPTION
The ossdevlinks utility creates and manages old style (legacy) device files
for OSS audio, MIDI and mixer devices.

In previous versioms OSS used "flat" device numbering for the device files
(for example /dev/dsp0 to /dev/dspN). OSS version 4.0 and later uses different
naming scheme. The ossdevlinks utility is used to manage the legacy device
names as symbolic links to the new style devices.

.SH OPTIONS
Normally ossdevlinks is used without command line arguments. However
there are few command line options.

-v		Verbose output
-r		Reset the legacy device numbering (do not use).

The -r option will invalidate audio device selections in the setup files
of various applications. This is considered highly undesirable. Applications
using wrong audio devices may cause serious security and privacy problems.
For this reason the -r option should never be used unless there are no other
ways to recover from serious audio/sound related problems. After that users
should review the audio settings of all the audio applications they are using.
