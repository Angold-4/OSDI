.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mkdist
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Mkdist
makes a MINIX 3 distribution on floppies.  Run the command as
.B root
and follow the instructions.  It will make one or two bootable installation
floppies and a compressed tar file of
.B /usr
on several floppies using
.BR vol (1).
.PP
The result can be installed on another system as described in
.BR usage (8),
except that all of
.B /usr
is saved on one set of floppies instead of being nicely split in binary
and source packages.
