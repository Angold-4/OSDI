.SH NAME
osscore - Open Sound Sytem core audio framework.

.SH DESCRIPTION
Open Sound System core audio support psudo driver. This driver implements the core Open Sound System API for audio, midi, mixer and synth functions. This driver also implements the OS driver interface as well as device configuration and setup. 
More information on programming on the OSS API is avaialable at:
http://manuals.opensound.com/

.SH OPTIONS
.IP \(bu 3
ac97_recselect	When set to 1 this option enables independent
		recording source selection for the left and the right channel
		on AC97 devices. In this way it's possible to record audio
		streams so that (for example) the left channel signal comes
		from the microphone and
		the right channel signal from line-in. However when this
		option is enabled it's only possible to select the recording
		source by using a fully OSS 4.0 compatible mixer program such
		as ossxmix.
		Default: 0 - recording source is common to both channels.
.IP \(bu 3
ac97_amplifier	When set to 1 this option enables the speaker power
		amplifier feature of AC97 codec (if available).
		Some boards have this inverted, so this feature can be
		disabled by setting this option to 0.
		Affects all AC97 based audio devices in the system.
		Default: -1=autodetect correct setting.
.IP \(bu 3
cooked_enable		By default OSS will let applications to use sampling
		rates and formats that are not supported by the hardware.
		Instead OSS performs the necessary format conversions in
		software. Applications that don't tolerate this kind of
		conversions usually disable them by using features of the OSS
		API (SNDCTL_DSP_COOKEDMODE). If this option is set to 0 then
		the format conversions will be disabled for all applications
		and devices unless the application explicitly enables them.
		Default: 1 - conversions are enabled.
		This option should not be changed without very strong reasons.
.IP \(bu 3
detect_trace 	Internal debugging (do not change). Default: 0
.IP \(bu 3
dma_buffsize	By default OSS will allocate audio DMA buffers with some
		system dependent default size (usually 64k but sometimes
		smaller). It is possible to change this default allocation by
		setting this option. Value of 0 means that the default size
		will be used. Value between 16 and 128 (kilobytes) can be used
		if the default size is not suitable for some reason.
		Default: 0 - system dependent buffsize.
		This option mustn't be changed unless it's absolutely necessary.
.IP \(bu 3
max_intrate	Set the maximum number of interrupts per second.
		Default: 100 interrupts per second which equals to about
		10 msec minimum latencies.
.IP \(bu 3
vmix_disabled		The virtual mixer subsystem can be disabled by setting
		this configuration option to 1.
		Default: 0 - virtual mixer is enabled.
.IP \(bu 3
vmix_loopdevs		Optionally the virtual mixer subsystem can create
		special loopback audio devices that can be used to record the
		output mix sent to the device. This option tells how many
		loopback devices will be created (0, 1 or 2). If there are
		multiple audio devices in the system the all of them will have
		the same number of loopback devices.
		Default: 0 - no loopback devices are created.
		This setting should be left to 0 unless there are specific
		reasons to enable the loopback devices.
.IP \(bu 3
vmix_no_autoattach	By default (0) the low level
		drivers for most sound cards will automatically
		attach virtual mixer (vmix) to the primary audio devices of the cards.
		In some situations it may be necessary to attach virtual mixer using 
		nonstandard parameters. If vmix_no_autoattach is set to 1 then user
		can use vmixctl attach command to attach virtual mixer manually to
		the device(s).
		Default: 0 - Automatically attach virtual mixer.
