audio controllers.

       o mono/stereo playback/recording
       o 8KHz to 48Khz sample rate

APCI97 MIXER EXTENSIONS

Dual Dac mode: This feature turns the APCI97 into two output devices with
the output going to front and rear speakers independantly (however volume
control is global).

Speaker Mode: This feature allows you to either have the audio coming out
the front speakers or you can have audio duplicated on rear speakers. This
mode is disabled when Dual Dac mode is enabled.

SPDIF: This button enables or disables SPDIF output.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP \(bu 3
apci97_latency=<NNN> 
Certain models of the ES1371 sound devices will sound distorted playing stereo
audio and setting the PCI latency fixes the problem

.IP \(bu 3
apci_spdif=0|1
Certain models like the SB 4.1D/SB PCI128D have SPDIF output jacks and 
this setting enables the output device.
