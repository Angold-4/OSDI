96kHz. sampling rates.


.SH MIXER PANEL

Note! For recording you need to set digi96.sync to INTERNAL and the values
     of digi96.mode and digi96.input to match your studio setup. Otherwise
     recordings will fail with I/O error.

There are several settings that can be changed using the ossmix program
shipped with OSS. Note that some features don't work with all Digi96
family members. For example ADAT mode is not supported by the base
model.

.IP \(bu 3
digi96.mode <SPDIF|AESEBU|ADAT>:
This setting controls the output mode which can be S/PDIF (consumer),
AES/EBU (professional) or ADAT. The input mode is detected automatically.
If ADAT input is detected the output mode will be switched to ADAT
automatically (this doesn't work in the other direction).

.IP \(bu 3
digi96.sync <EXTERNAL|INTERNAL>:
This setting tells if the playback sampling rate is based on the internal
oscillator or the sample rate detected in the input port. See also the
definition of the digi96.worldclk setting.

.IP \(bu 3
digi96.input <OPTICAL|COAXIAL|INTERNAL|XLR>: Selects the active input.

.IP \(bu 3
digi96.sel <BYPASS|NORMAL>: 
When set to BYPASS the input signal will be routed directly to the
output (also sets digi96.sync automatically to EXTERNAL). In this mode
audio data written to /dev/dsp will be muted.

.IP \(bu 3
digi96.worldclk ON|OFF:
Setting this control to ON will enable the optional worldclock input as
the sample rate source (overrides the digi96.sync setting).

.IP \(bu 3
digi96.emph ON|OFF:
Enables/disables the de-emphasis option on the analog (monitor) output
connector.

.IP \(bu 3
digi96.data <AUDIO|AC3>:
Specifies if the output signal is audio or AC3 data (sets the non-audio
bit in the channel status data).
