.SH NAME
oss_geode - National Semiconductor Geode audio driver.

.SH DESCRIPTION
Open Sound System driver for National Semiconductor Geode/CS5530/CS5536 audio 
controllers.

Geode device characteristics:
       o 8/16 bit playback/record
       o mono/stereo playback/recording
       o 8KHz to 48Khz sample rate.

.SH NOTES
Some old Geode CPUs are not able to handle heavy computational loads.
If your audio streams are use a lot of CPU, you can start getting garbled audio
since the OSS Sample Rate Convertor is CPU intensive. Setting vmix0-src to
OFF will allow you to play audio but only at a fixed rate set via vmixctl
(Default: 48Khz).
