.SH NAME
oss_hdaudio - Intel High Definition Audio (AZALIA) 

.SH DESCRIPTION
 Open Sound System driver for Intels high definition audio known as 
 "Azalia". This driver supports Intel 915/925 chipsets with the
 Realtek ALC880 and CMedia 9880 8 channel codecs.

 The HDA driver supports:

 o 8-96Khz Playback/Recording
 o 8 or 16 or 32 bits
 o 2, 4, 6 or 8 channel audio.
 o SPDIF digital output and Input
 o AC3 passthrough 

.SH  HDAUDIO MIXER
 The Intel HDA mixer is a new type of mixer that doesn't have
 the normal volume controls found on AC97 or legacy SB devices.
 The HDA mixer presents a concept of Jacks and you can configure
 any jack to be either an output or an input jack.

 Some motherboards may not correctly initialize the jacks according
 to their color and functionality but in general here's the 
 configuration that should generally be followed:

	o Orange = Center/LFE	o Blue = Line-in
	o Black = Rear		o Green = Front
	o Grey = Side		o Pink = Mic

Some Azalia codecs support front panel connectors and so if you see
fp-green and fp-pink connectors, then these are for front panel
speaker and mic/line-in Jacks.

There is a function selector for most of the analog audio jacks (for example
connector.pink.mode). This selector is used to control if the jack is used
as an input (microphone or line in) or output (front, rear, side, speaker,
etc).

.SH KNOWN PROBLEMS
In general Azalia based systems (laptops/motherboards) would require a custom
driver to work properly. Due to enormous number of different systems it is not
possible to develop such custom drivers for all systems. A generic driver is 
used for systems that don't have dedicated drivers.

Unfortunately the mixer and control panel interface (see ossmix(1)) 
for "generic" systems is very cryptic and difficult to
understand. To solve problems with volumes or signal routing you need to
start ossxmix(1) and change the controls one at time until you get the desired
effect.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP \(bu 3
hdaudio_jacksense	enables jack sensing mode when the hdaudio driver is
			loaded. In this mode all I/O pin's that are not
			in use will be disabled as well as the mixer controls
			that are related with them. In this way the
			mixer/control panel will become more intuitive.
			However OSS will need to be restarted with soundoff;
			soundon every time new inputs or outputs are attached
			to the audio jacks. Default : 0.

			NOTE! hdaudio_jacksense=1 works only in some systems.
			Many laptops and motherboards don't support jack
			sensing.

.IP \(bu 3
hdaudio_noskip	Disable skipping unconnected jack. All mixer controls
			will be shown, even for disabled I/O pins.
			Can get values 0-7. 1-7 is a bitmask, where every bit
			masks a different check. Bit 3 (= value 4) overrides
			jacksense check too.
			Default: 0 - unconnected jacks are skipped.
