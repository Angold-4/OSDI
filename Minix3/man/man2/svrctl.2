.SH NAME
svrctl \- special server control functions
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.ft B
#include <sys/svrctl.h>

int svrctl(u32_t \fIrequest\fP, void *\fIdata\fP);
.ft R
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Svrctl
allows root to control the kernel in various ways, or implements some very
MINIX 3 specific system calls that don't deserve their own system call number.
.PP
This system call makes it easy to add new ways of setting and getting kernel
parameters, but at the same time, backwards compatibility is not guaranteed.
Read the <sys/svrctl.h> include file to see what the struct's mentioned below
look like.  Most calls are root-only, unless specified otherwise.
.PP
The only way to know how to properly use these calls is to study the
associated kernel or server code, or the programs that already use these
calls.
.PP
Current requests are:
.TP 5
.B MMSIGNON
Inform MM that the current process wants to become a server.
.TP
.B MMSWAPON
Instruct MM to mount a file or device as swapspace.
.TP
.B MMSWAPOFF
Tell MM to stop using swapspace.
.TP
.B FSSIGNON
Register a new device with FS.
.TP
.B SYSSIGNON
Inform the kernel that the process want to become a server.
The processes task number is filled-in in a \fBstruct systaskinfo\fP.
.TP
.B SYSGETENV
Request the value of one or all boot parameters.  Can be used by non-root.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.B Svrctl
returns 0 upon success and -1 upon failure.
