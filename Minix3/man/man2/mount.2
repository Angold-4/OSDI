.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Mount()
tells the system that the file system
.I special
is to be mounted on the file
.IR name ,
effectively overlaying
.I name
with the file tree on
.IR special .
.I Name
may of any type, except that if the root of
.I special
is a directory, then
.I name
must also be a directory.
.I Special
must be a block special file, except for loopback mounts.  For loopback
mounts a normal file or directory is used for
.IR special ,
which must be seen as the root of a virtual device.
.I Flag
is 0 for a read-write mount, 1 for read-only.
.I Type
is the type of the file system (e.g. "mfs"), used to pick a file system server.
If this parameter is NULL, the default type is used.
.I Args
is a string with arguments passed to the file system server.
Their interpretation is up to the server.
This parameter may be NULL as well.
.PP
.B Umount()
removes the connection between a device and a mount point,
.I name
may refer to either of them.  If more than one device is mounted on the
same mount point then unmounting at the mount point removes the last mounted
device, unmounting a device removes precisely that device.  The unmount will
only succeed if none of the files on the device are in use.
.PP
Both calls may only be executed by the super-user.
