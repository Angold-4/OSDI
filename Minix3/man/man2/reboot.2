.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Reboot()
is used to close down the system.  It allows several ways of shutting
down depending on
.IR how :
.PP
.TP 5
.BI "reboot(RBT_HALT)"
Halt the system and return to the monitor prompt.
.TP
.BI "reboot(RBT_REBOOT)"
Reboot the system by letting the monitor execute the "boot" command.
.TP
.BI "reboot(RBT_PANIC)"
Cause a system panic.  This is not normally done from user mode, but by
servers using the
.B sys_abort()
kernel call.
.TP
.BI "reboot(RBT_MONITOR" ", code, length" ")"
Halt the system and let the monitor execute the given code of the given
length.
.RI ( code
is of type
.B "char *"
and
.I length
of type
.BR size_t .)
.TP
.BI "reboot(RBT_RESET)"
Reboot the system with a hardware reset.
.PP
.B Reboot()
may only be executed by the super-user.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
If the call succeeds, it never returns.  If something went wrong,
the return value is -1 and an error is indicated by
.BR errno .
.SH SEE ALSO
.BR shutdown (8),
.BR reboot (8),
.BR halt (8),
.BR sync (2).
.SH NOTES
MINIX 3 can not return to the monitor if running in real mode.  This means
that most of the reboot functions will change to a system reset.
