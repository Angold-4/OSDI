.TH NOHUP 1
.SH NAME
nohup \- ignore hangup signal
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBnohup\fP \fIutility\fP [\fIargument\fP...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B nohup
utility runs \fIutility\fP while ignoring the SIGHUP signal. This 
allows the process to continue running after the current terminal
exits, for example when logging off a telnet session. 

Unless output is explicitly redirected when invoking nohup, output is 
appended to a file named nohup.out. This file is created in the current
directory or, if this is not possible, in $HOME. If the standard error 
stream is not explicitly redirected, it is sent to the standard output.
