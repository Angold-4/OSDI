.SH NAME
ossmix - Open Sound System command-line mixer program.

.SH SYNOPSIS
ossmix [-d <dev#>] [-chqD] [control name] [value]

.SH DESCRIPTION
ossmix is a simple command-line mixer utility that is used to display the mixer
settings of physical and virtual audio devices. OSS version 4 has an extended
mixer API which supports some device specific features that may not available
using other mixer applications. 

.SH OPTIOMS
-D		Display device information.
-c		Dump mixer settings for all mixers.
-h		Display usage information.
-q		Quiet mode.
-v[1|2]		Verbose mode. -v2 prints more detailed infoamation than -v1.
ctrl# value	Change value of a mixer control.
<no arg>	Display current/possible settings.

.SH USAGE
ossmix without any arguments displays the current settings of the
default mixer device (usually the motherboard sound chip). This
printout can also be used to find out the supported control names and
their possible values. Currently all controls accept an ON/OFF value, a
mono value (0 to 100) or a stereo value (left:right where both channel
volumes can be between 0 and 100). The value can also be expressed in a
relative form (e.g. +1 to add 1 to the previous volume).
The following is a sample printout produced by ossmix:

	Selected mixer 0/Creative AudioPCI
	Known controls are:
	vol <both/leftvol>[:<rightvol>] (currently 50:50)
	pcm <both/leftvol>[:<rightvol>] (currently 50:50)
	speaker <monovol> (currently 21)
	line <both/leftvol>[:<rightvol>] (currently 32:32)
	line.rec ON|OFF (currently OFF)
	mic <monovol> (currently 16)
	mic.rec ON|OFF (currently ON)
	cd <both/leftvol>[:<rightvol>] (currently 100:100)
	cd.rec ON|OFF (currently OFF)
	pcm2 <both/leftvol>[:<rightvol>] (currently 75:75)
	line1 <both/leftvol>[:<rightvol>] (currently 32:32)
	line1.rec ON|OFF (currently OFF)
	line2 <monovol> (currently 32)
	line2.rec ON|OFF (currently OFF)
	line3 <monovol> (currently 0)
	line3.rec ON|OFF (currently OFF)
	mic.micboost ON|OFF (currently ON)
	mic.micbias ON|OFF (currently ON)
	mute.pcmmute ON|OFF (currently OFF)
	mute.pcm2mute ON|OFF (currently OFF)
	mute.micmute ON|OFF (currently OFF)
	mute.cdmute ON|OFF (currently OFF)
	mute.linemute ON|OFF (currently OFF)
	mute.line1mute ON|OFF (currently OFF)
	mute.line2mute ON|OFF (currently OFF)
	mute.line3mute ON|OFF (currently OFF)

.SH SELECTING MIXER DEVICE
It's possible to select the mixer device by using the -d<mixernumber>
command line argument. This argument (when used) should be the first one
on the command line. By default the mixer number 0 will be accessed.
To find the available mixer devices, type ossinfo -x and look
under the Mixers heading for available mixer devices. 

.SH CHANGING MIXER SETTINGS
Changing the values is done just like with the original "mixer" applet.
For example:

	ossmix pcm 50:60

The above sets the pcm control (audio playback volume) so that the left
channel volume is 50 and the right channel volume is 60. With just
"ossmix pcm 50" the both channel volumes will be set to 50.

In addition to the old mixer there are now some (usually ON/OFF) settings.
These settings are device specific and don't work with all soundcards.
The easiest way to find them out is to start ossmix without command line
arguments (other than -d#).

Some control names contain a dot ("."). This dot is required when changing
the value. For example: "ossmix -d0 mic.micboost ON".

."USING OSSMIX WITH A MIDI CONTROLLED MIXER
."The ossmix program has capability to listen MIDI main volume controller
."messages from a MIDI port. You can assign a ossmix control to each MIDI
."channel. After receiving a channel main volume change message ossmix will then
."change the mixer level of the volume control assigned to the channel. In this
."mode ossmix will not exit (you need to kill it manually).
."
."This mode is very useful if you need to make several rapid mixer changes
."simultaneously.
."
."To use this mode you need to give the MIDI device file and a list of the
."volume sliders on command line. For example:
."
."    ossmix -d1 -m/dev/midi00 vol mic pcm line gain.out1/2 gain.in3/4
."
."After that the MIDI channels will be assigned in the following way:
."
."    Ch 0 = "vol"
."    Ch 1 = "mic"
."    Ch 2 = "pcm"
."    Ch 3 = "line"
."    Ch 4 = "gain.out1/2"
."    Ch 5 = "gain.in3/4"
."
."Other MIDI channels (6 to 15) will be ignored.
."
."Only mono and stereo slider type controls can be assigned to MIDI channels.
."Both stereo channels will be set to the same volume (there is no balance 
."support).
."
."After starting ossmix you should move the sliders on the external fader box
."so that ossmix can figure out their current settings.
."
."At this moment only MIDI fader boxes that send only main volume change messages
."are supported (any other MIDI data will make ossmix to behave incorrectly).
."For example the FM3 MIDI Mixer (AKA "FaderBaby") by JLCooper is compatible
."with ossmix.
