.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fIM\fR and \fIU\fR allow easy mounting and unmounting of a device by using
only an abbreviated device name or keyword.  Special keywords are
\fBroot\fR, \fBtmp\fR, and \fBusr\fR for the three hard disk partitions
MINIX 3 runs in.  Floppy devices are mounted on \fB/fd0\fR or \fB/fd1\fR.  You
can use \fB0\fR and \fB1\fR instead of \fBfd0\fR and \fBfd1\fP.  A device it
doesn't know about is mounted on \fB/mnt\fR.
