.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.I Postmort
does a simple static analysis of a PC MINIX 3 core file;
By default, it looks for the
file 'core' in the local directory and loads that for analysis; it
also searches for the file 'symbol.out', and if that fails 'a.out',
expecting them to contain symbol information for the core file.
It is not a fatal error if the symbol files don't exist.
.PP
The stack backtrace is slightly tricky, and may go on longer
than is really justified, since there's no easy way for it to
know when to stop.  Treat its results with caution.
