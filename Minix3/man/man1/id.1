.SH EXAMPLES
.EX "id" "Print the uid and gid"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fIId\fR prints the current uid and gid, both numerically and symbolically.
If the effective uid and gid are different from the real ones, all of them
are printed.
.PP
If the \fB\-u\fP or \fB\-g\fP option is specified, then \fBid\fP will print
the effective uid or guid number, respectively, on a single line. Combined
with either of those options, the \fB\-n\fP option prints the name instead of
the number, and the \fB\-r\fP option prints the real instead of the effective
uid or gid.
