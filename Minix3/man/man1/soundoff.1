.SH NAME
soundoff - Stop Open Sound System

.SH DESCRIPTION

The soundoff command can be used to stop Open Sound System and to unload the
kernel modules related with it.

There are no command line arguments. Only the super user (root) can use this
command.

Open Sound System can be loaded by executing the soundon command.

.SH SAVING THE MIXER AND CONTROL PANEL SETTINGS AUTOMATICALLY

By default soundoff will save the current mixer and control panel settings
automatically each time soundoff is executed. The saved settings will be 
restored automatically when soundon is executed next time.

This automatic save feature can be disabled by editing /usr/lib/oss/etc/userdefs
and by changing the line containing "autosave_mixer yes" to
"autosave_mixer no". After this the mixer settings will only be saved when
the savemixer command is executed (by super user).
