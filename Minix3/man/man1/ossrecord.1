.SH NAME
ossrecord - Open Sound System recording program.

.SH USAGE
ossrecord [options] filename

.SH DESCRIPTION
The ossrecord program records audio in Microsoft RIFF (wav) format. It
will record from any input that's currently set as the recording source
by the ossxmix/ossmix mixer programs. With the -l option, you also get
a level meter that will display VU levels in a character mode.

The filename parameter is name of the (.wav) file to be produced. Output can be
sent to stdout by giving - as the file name.

.SH OPTIONS
-s<rate> 	Select the recording rate for raw PCM audio (eg -s48000).
-c<channels> 	Select the number of channels 1=mono 2=stereo, 4, 6, 8, etc. 
-d<devname>  	Select <devname> as the device (eg -d/dev/dsp2).
-f<fmt>		Select the output sample format (eg -fS32_LE or -fMU_LAW)
-f?		Prints the list of supported format names.
-F<cnt>		Select the container format (eg WAV or AU). Default is WAV.
-F?		Prints the list of supported container formats.
-R		Open audio device in raw mode to disable virtual mixing and
		sample rate/format conversions. Can be used when recording
		from a digital source (S/PDIF input).
-v		Verbose output.
-l		Display level meters (character based).
-i<recsrc|?> 	Select the recording source or display available recording 
		sources if '?' is supplied.
		e.g. ossrecord -i? may display:
			        vol
       			line (currently selected)
       			mic
       			cd
       			aux1
       			phone
       			mono
       			video
-m<nfiles> 	Repeat the recording operation <nfiles> times. The filename
		argument must have %d (or %02d) somewhere in the file to
		guarantee unique filenames. If no %d is given then subsequent
		recordings will overwrite the previous one(s). This option is
		useful only with loopback audio devices or if the -t option
		is used.
-r<command> 	This option launches the <command> in background after 
		recording the file has completed. The name of the recorded file
		will be given as the (only) command line argument. When the -m 
		option is used the script will run in parallel while recording
		the next file. See the COMMAND SCRIPT section (below) for more
		info.
-g<gain>	Amplify recorded samples by percentage given as argument.
		100 (default) means normal signal level, 200 means double level.
		Only supported in 16 and 32 bit modes.
-t<maxsecs>	Do not record more than <maxsecs> seconds in a single recording
		operation.
-L<level>	Set the recording level to <level>.
-O		Allow overwriting of file when recording.
-h		Display usage instructions.

.SH COMMAND SCRIPT
		The -r command line argument makes it possible to execute a
		script or program after recording of the wave file is finished.
		Below is a simple scell script that does MP3 encoding using
		lame.

#!/bin/sh

WAVENAME=$1

MP3NAME=$1.mp3

lame -m s -h --preset studio $WAVENAME $MP3NAME

exit 0

Another example script for ossrecord is a simple CGI script for live MP3
streaming (from /dev/dsp).

#!/bin/sh

echo Content-Type: audio/mp3

echo

ossrecord -S -b16 -s48 - | lame -m j - -

exit 0

The ossrecord executable is the same as the ossplay executable.
Behaviour is decided by the name used to invoke the program.
