.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fIUuencode\fR is a famous program that converts an arbitrary (usually binary)
file to an encoding using only 64 ASCII characters.
\fIUudecode\fR converts it back to the original file.
The \fIuue\fR and \fIuud\fR programs are the 
\s-1MINIX 3\s-1
versions of these programs, and are compatible with the \s-2UNIX\s0 ones.
The files produced can even be sent successfully over BITNET, which is 
notorious for mangling files.
It is possible to have \fIuue\fR automatically split the encoded file up
into small chunks.
The output files then get the suffixes \fI.uaa\fR, \fI.uab\fR, etc., instead
of \fI.uue\fR.
When \fIuud\fR is given \fIfile.uaa\fR to decode, it automatically includes
the subsequent pieces.
The encoding takes 3 bytes (24 bits) from the input file and renders it 
as 4 bytes in the output file.
