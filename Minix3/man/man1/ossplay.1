.SH NAME
ossplay - Open Sound System playback program.

.SH SYNOPSIS
ossplay [-FRhlvq] [-S secs ] [ -c channels ] [ -d devname ]
       [ -f fmtname | ? ] [ -g gain ] [ -o playtarget | ? ]
       [ -s rate ] filename | - ...

.SH DESCRIPTION
ossplay plays raw PCM, Microsoft RIFF (.wav), Sun ULaw (.au), Mac AIFF (.aif)
and other types of audio files. By default the application will try to
determine the audio file's format and play audio based on the stored
inforation about sample format, number of channels and sampling rate.

.SH OPTIONS
-v		Verbose output. Multiple invocations increase the level
		of verbosity.
-q		Quiet (no information printed).
-l		Loop playback indefinately.
-d<devname> 	Select <devname> as the device (eg -d/dev/dsp2).
-s<rate> 	Select the playback rate for raw PCM audio (eg -s48000).
-c<channels 	Select the number of channels 1=mono 2=stereo, 4, 6, 8, etc.

-o<playtarget> 	Selects the play target name if the device supports multiple
		play targets (such as front, rear, side). 
-o? 		Prints the list of available play targets.
-g<gain>	Amplify all played samples by percentage given as argument. 
		100 (default) means normal signal level, 200 means double level.
-F		Treat all input as raw PCM data.
-R		Disable redirection to virtual mixer engines and sample
		rate/format conversions. Should not be used unless absolutely
