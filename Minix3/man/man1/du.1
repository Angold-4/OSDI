.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fIDu\fR examines one or more directories and prints the amount of space 
occupied by the files in those directories and their subdirectories in
kilobytes.
.SH BUGS
\fIDu\fR calculates disk usage based on file size. It could be there
are holes in the file, not occupying any actual disk blocks, causing
\fIdu\fR to overestimate disk usage. (\fIDu\fR does recognize and correctly
calculate disk usage when hard links are encountered.)
