.SH NAME
finger \- user information lookup program
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B finger
[
options
] name ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
By default
.B finger
lists the login name, full name, terminal name and write status
(as a `*' before the terminal name if write permission is denied),
idle time, login time, and office location and phone number
(if they are known) for each current UNIX user.
(Idle time is minutes if it is a single integer, hours and minutes if a ':'
is present, or days and hours if a 'd' is present.)
.PP
A longer format also exists and is used by
.B finger
whenever a list of people's names is given.  (Account names as well as
first and last names of users are accepted.)
This format is multi-line, and includes all the information described above
as well as the user's home
directory and login shell, any plan which the person has placed in the file
.B \&.plan
in their home
directory, and the project on which they are working from the file
.B \&.project
also in the home directory.
.PP
.B Finger
may be used to lookup users on a remote machine.  The format is to specify
the user as ``user@host.''  If the user name is left off, the
standard format listing is provided on the remote machine.

uses an internet standard port.
