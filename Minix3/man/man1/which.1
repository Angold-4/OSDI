.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The $PATH shell variable controls the 
\s-1MINIX 3\s-1
search rules. 
If a command \fIa.out\fR is given, the shell first tries to find an 
executable file in the working directory.  
If that fails, it looks in various system directories, such as 
\fI/bin\fR and \fI/usr/bin\fR.  
The\fR which\fR command makes the same search and gives the absolute
path of the program that will be chosen, followed by other occurrences
of the file name along the path.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR man (1).
