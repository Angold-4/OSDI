all the lines that match the pattern.
All the regular expressions accepted by
.I ed
and
.I mined 
are allowed.
In addition, + can be used instead of \(** to mean 1 or more occurrences,
? can be used to mean 0 or 1 occurrences, and
| can be used between two regular expressions to mean either
one of them.
Parentheses can be used for grouping.
If a match is found, exit status 0 is returned.
If no match is found, exit status 1 is returned.
If an error is detected, exit status 2 is returned.
