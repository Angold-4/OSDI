The driver has been tested on Minix 3.1.3, svn revision 2928:
	http://derelict.cs.vu.nl/images/minix3_1_3_ide_r2928.iso.bz2


To install the driver do:
#sh install_script

This script will patch, compile and install 2 code files in Minix:
	/usr/src/services/rs/service.c
	/usr/src/commands/dhcpd/devices.c
	(see the docs directory for more information)
Furthermore, the script will patch 1 configuration file:
	/etc/drivers.conf
	(adding an entry for 'orinoco')
and 1 script file:
	/usr/etc/rc
	(adding an entry in a for-loop to start orinoco)
Finally, the script will copy the orinoco driver into the drivers directory,
compile and install it.

When the script completes successfully, the inet.conf file has to be adjusted 
so that Minix will use the orinoco driver. Add an entry like:

	eth0 orinoco 0 {default;};

The last step is to set the essid and WEP key of the network in the boot 
monitor. When in the boot monitor, type:
	essid=<essid>
	wep=<WEP key>
	save

The essid is the name of the wireless network
The WEP key is a string of 13 ASCII characters, being the key of the wireless 
network. This variable shouldn't be set when the network is not WEP protected.
If the essid is not set, the card will just try connect a network quite at random

N.B.: WPA is not supported
N.B.: WEP seems to be buggy. At my place it works, at the VU it doesnt. So if 
things don't work, try without WEP
