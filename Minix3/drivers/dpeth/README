This is my implementation of a new network task 
for the Minix kernel.  I did it initially to handle
a 3c501 board (Etherlink), but those board are so
unstable that it is not worth using them except for
learning how to implement a driver.  When I got a
3c509b board (Etherlink III) it was easier to
write the code to handle them.  

The Minix code in 'dp8390.c' is too specific for the
National chip set, so what I did was to remove as 
much as I needed of the code dependant from the chip
and produce a generic task that, I hope, will be able
to handle many more cards.

Revision 1.1  2005/06/29 10:16:46  beng
Import of dpeth 3c501/3c509b/.. ethernet driver by
Giovanni Falzoni <fgalzoni@inwind.it>.

Revision 1.3  2004/04/14 12:49:07  lsodgf0
Changes for porting to Minix 2.0.4 run on BOCHS

Revision 1.2  2002/03/25 14:16:09  lsodgf0
The driver for the NEx000 has been rewritten to be
operational with the ACCTON 18xx (an NE1000 clone)
The I/O routines for 16 bit cards are still untested..

Revision 1.1  2002/02/09 09:35:09  lsodgf0
Initial revision
The package is not fully tested, i.e. I had only 3Com
boards (3c501, 3c503, 3c503/16 and 3c509b) and WD8003.
I got also a NE1000 clone but it was not fully
operational and I could not appreciate the results.
For this reason the changes done to the interface
to I/O for 8 and 16 bits are not tested.
