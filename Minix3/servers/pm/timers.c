/* PM watchdog timer management. These functions in this file provide
 * a convenient interface to the timers library that manages a list of
 * watchdog timers. All details of scheduling an alarm at the CLOCK task 
 * are hidden behind this interface.
 * Only system processes are allowed to set an alarm timer at the kernel. 
 * Therefore, the PM maintains a local list of timers for user processes
 * that requested an alarm signal. 
 * 
 * The entry points into this file are:
 *   pm_set_timer:      reset and existing or set a new watchdog timer
 *   pm_expire_timers:  check for expired timers and run watchdog functions
 *   pm_cancel_timer:   remove a time from the list of timers
 *
